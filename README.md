##Todo-project
##Abstract:
The Todo List project is a web application that helps users manage their tasks by providing a platform to create, edit, and delete tasks. The application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack, which provides a full-stack solution for building web applications.

##Software Requirements:
To develop the Todo List project using the MERN stack, the following software requirements must be met:

Node.js: Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment used to build server-side applications. It will be used to develop the back-end of the application.

MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL document-oriented database that will be used to store the application data.

Express.js: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js used to build the application's back-end.

React: React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces for web applications. It will be used to build the application's front-end.

Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Code is a lightweight and powerful code editor that will be used to develop the application's code.

Git: Git is a version control system that will be used to manage the application's code.

GitHub: GitHub is a web-based platform used to host and share code repositories.

In summary, to develop the Todo List project using the MERN stack, you will need to install Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, React, Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub. These software tools will provide a complete development environment for building the Todo List project.
